                <p class="col-lg-7 text-center text-lg-end">Hello! My name is Noa Gadot and I am the owner of the only Cat Caf'e in
                    Israel. CATTUCCINO is on a mission to make people feel better.
                    We believe that somehow, cats can help us physically, mentally and emotionally.
                    Research has shown that hearing a cat purr can lower your blood pressure and stroking a cat can slow
                    your heart rate. So by stopping, resting, and watching, it is Cat Café’s aim to enable people to
                    become more mindful and present in their day-to-day lives. In essence, it is our ambition to
                    encourage the people of Britain’s greatest cities to be more cat.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Today people are busier than they ever have been before.
                    It’s no secret that highly domesticated pets require around the clock care and attention. As people
                    are becoming busier, their pets are becoming bored. House cats need constant stimuli to keep them
                    happy. They need to hunt, to play, and to socialise with other cats and humans to lead truly
                    satisfying feline lives.
                    Cat Café bridges this gap. Now you can be busy, and share a cat. You can go out every night of the
                    week and your cat will be looked after twenty-four hours of the day. Because our cats are your cats.
                    Our aim is to create relaxed and peaceful spaces, free from stress, where cats and humans can come
                    alongside each other and rest. We are an escape. A safe haven.
                    Cat Café can give you a new perspective, it can make you present, and it can refresh and heal an
                    urban soul.

            <h3 class="display-6">Origin of Cat Cafes</h3>
            <p>
                Cat cafes originated in Taiwan, with one opening in Taipei in 1998. The cafe became popular with
                Japanese tourists as well as local visitors, who enjoyed the opportunity to interact with some furry
                friends.</p>

                <figcaption>The first Cat Caf'e in Japan</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
            <h3 class="display-6">Expansion to Japan</h3>
            One of the Japanese tourists took the idea back to Japan, and the first Japanese cat cafe opened its doors
            in Osaka in 2004. They’ve become very popular in Japan, with Tokyo home to at least 39. Japan as a whole has
            over 150 cat cafes. Because many apartments in Japan forbid pet ownership, the popularity of the cafes has
            been attributed to a desire to interact with cats to help relieve the stress of a busy urban life.

            Many people attribute the growth of cat cafes to tourists. But step outside the areas where tourists visit,
            and you’ll see lots of Japanese businessmen happily playing with cats as a way to relax and forget about
            work for a while.<span id="dots">..</span><span id="more"></p>
            
            <p><h3 class="display-6">Growth Throughout the World</h3>
                Since then, cat cafes have spread throughout the world.  You can now find them in Korea, Austria, Spain, Hungary, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.  Cat cafes moved into North America in 2014, with the first one opening in Montreal. Oakland was next, and then came to New York. When we opened The Cat Cafe in January 2015, we became the fifth cat cafe in the United States.</p>
                <p><h3 class="display-6">Cat Cafes in the United States</h3>
                    Within the United States, compliance with food service regulations has been a challenge.  The Japanese are known for being a very clean society. They allow cat cafes to serve food and drink in the area where the cats are. But sadly, that’s not how it works in the United States.
                    The Cat Cafe had to separate the cat playpen, where the cats are, from the coffee bar. And that’s why we have a design that we don’t really like. We have multiple doors and a wall separating our coffee bar from the cats.</span>
